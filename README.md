# Bitcoin Sentiment and Trend Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes sentiment from Bitcoin-related tweets and compares the sentiment with current Bitcoin values to predict whether it is a good time to buy Bitcoin. The project combines sentiment analysis and trend prediction using advanced machine learning and natural language processing techniques.

## Features
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Utilizes NLTK's sentiment analyzer to determine the overall sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of tweets related to Bitcoin.
- **Trend Prediction**: Uses an LSTM model to predict future trends in Bitcoin prices based on historical data.
- **Decision Support**: Combines sentiment analysis and trend predictions to generate actionable insights on Bitcoin investments.
- **Report Generation**: Generates a comprehensive report using Google Gemini Pro API.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**
- **NLTK**: For sentiment analysis
- **LSTM**: For Bitcoin trend prediction
- **Google Gemini Pro API**: For generating detailed reports
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow/Keras, Tweepy (for Twitter API)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bhargavmupparisetty/Bitcoin-Sentiment-and-Trend-Analysis.git
